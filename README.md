- Should now be able to destroy all items as that seems to have been the intention of the mod

Detailed description by user Thundercraft


- It runs on electricity, requiring 250w (the same as the Crematorium it resembles).
- It has a cleanliness value of -20, just like a Crematorium.
- The research cost is 750, the tech level is Industrial and the prerequisite is Electricity.
- Building it costs 150 stone, 50 Steel and 5 Components, which is more than twice the Steel &amp; Components of a Crematorium.
- This Acid Chamber actually produces about 25% more heat than a Crematorium.
- A Crematorium has -10 Beauty, but this Acid Chamber does not.

Chamber full of acid designed to dissolve any item in a matter of minutes. Bulk(20x) option included as well. Works similar to the cremation chamber but for any in game item. Puts off a cancer causing green glow and leaks acid but it gets the job done. Even fits nicely into the Research tab.

Originally created for myself but figured some others might be interested. Please comment if you find bugs or whatever. I'm running a ton of mods and haven't had any problems yet. 

Supports v.16
