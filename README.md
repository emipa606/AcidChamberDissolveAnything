- Should now be able to destroy all items as that seems to have been the intention of the mod

Chamber full of acid designed to dissolve any item in a matter of minutes. Bulk(20x) option included as well. Works similar to the cremation chamber but for any in game item. Puts off a cancer causing green glow and leaks acid but it gets the job done. Even fits nicely into the Research tab.
